An RPG-lite interactive fiction engine written in PHP

---

Many years ago, I was inspired by the [Age of Fable] interactive fiction game.
It used RPG character statistics and "difficulty check" procedures to take an
otherwise standard interactive fiction experience and make it that much more
_alive_. I have recently decided to revive the project in hopes that it may
prove useful for building introductory adventures and other spin-off projects
related to different games and fictional universes.
